title: Plans for the Summer
---

So far, I have a few projects that I am really interested in getting some work done on, including being able to actually render a window in [waybox], possibly rewriting [Mangoterm] in Go instead of using python, and a few other small things I have had rolling around in my head.

I'm still on the search for an internship but I really hope I can find one soon. The paint industry has been pretty cool but it's not what I want to do forever. Summer classes also start soon and this should be the last of the lower than 400 level classes I will be taking.
Cheers to a good summer!
